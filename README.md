# hello_world
This particular repository will contain Ruby excercises preliminary to coursework from Odin Academy.
Excercises are derived from secondary tutorials featured in Odin Academy lessons.


I am learning the Ruby language in order to land a development job that will earn me a fun career at a tech company and allow me to live with my friends in our incubator.
